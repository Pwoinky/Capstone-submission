# Client and Server NPM install and setup

Open a integrated terminal in both the client and server side and run the following NPM install.

If this fails try NPM install --legacy-peer-deps

keeping both integrated terminals open run NPM start in each terminal.

Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Running unit tests (Client side only)
